# Anomaly-prediction-using-LSTM-neural-network

This project is aimed to predict anomalies during drilling by accurate LSTM regressor which predicts ROP on next steps. Anomaly will be detected as a high deviaton from predicted value

2 drilling accidents were considered: Drill string clogging and oil-,gas-,water- flows

RMSE for ROP prediction is 0.3 m/h
